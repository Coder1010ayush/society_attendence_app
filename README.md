# Society Attendance Portal App

This application provides a streamlined way to manage attendance for employees working within a society. It caters to two distinct user roles: Committee Members and Employees.

## Committee Member Section

Committee members have comprehensive control over the attendance system and employee records. Their functionalities include:

* **Add New Committee Member:** Ability to register new individuals as committee members within the application.
* **Add New Employee:** Capability to add new employee profiles, including their name and assigning them to a specific category (e.g., Plumber, Electrician, Chef, Gardener).
* **View Employee Attendance:**
    * **By Date:** Allows committee members to view the attendance records of all employees or specific employees for a selected date.
    * **By Category:** Enables filtering and viewing attendance based on employee categories (e.g., see the attendance of all Plumbers).
    * **Date Range:** Provides the option to view attendance records for a specified period.

## Employee Section

Employees have limited access focused solely on managing their own attendance records. Their functionalities include:

* **Mark Attendance:** A simple and intuitive way for employees to mark their daily attendance (e.g., clock-in).
* **View Last Month's Attendance:** Employees can view their attendance records for the preceding one-month period.
